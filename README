A ruby gem for rendering flash swf files. This project contains a
native exension which uses the AntiGrain Graphics Library to render
flash swf frames directly to PNGs. I've made a special effort to minimize
external dependencies so that compilation of the extension requires
only only stdc++ and libz.
